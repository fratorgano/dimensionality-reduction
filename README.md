# dimensionality-reduction
Shared git repository where we'll work on a project for a scientific visualization class. 
The main objecting is to learn a bit about some dimensionality reduction techniques and be ready to present them to class. 

This README file will be in English but almost everything else in this repository will be in Italian since we are following the class in Italian.

The algorithms we will be working on are:
* LLE - Locally Linear Embedding
* Isomap
* UMAP - Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction
